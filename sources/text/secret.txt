	  Somebody once told me the world was gonna roll me, I
	  ain't the sharpest tool in the shed. She was lookin'
	  kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb in the shape
	  of an L on her forehead.

	  Well, the years start comin' and the don't stop
	  comin'. Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
	  It didn't make sense not to live for fun. Your brain
	  gets smart but your head gets dumb. So much to do, so
	  much to see, so whats wrong with takin' the back
	  streets. You'll never know if you don't go. You'll
	  never shine if you don't glow.

	  Hey now, you're an all star. Get the game on, go
	  play. Hey now, you're a rockstar. Get the show on,
	  get paid. And all that glitters is gold. Only
	  shootin' stars break the mold.

	  It's a cool place and they say it gets colder.
	  You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older but the
	  meteor men beg to differ judging by the hole in the
	  satellite picture. The ice we skate is getting pretty
	  thin, the water's getting warm so you might as well
	  swim. My world's on fire, how about yours? That's the
	  way I like it and I never get bored.

	  Hey now, you're an all star. Get the game on, go
	  play. Hey now, you're a rockstar. Get the show on,
	  get paid. And all that glitters is gold. Only
	  shootin' stars break the mold.

	  (Go for the moon, go, go)
	  (Go for the moon, go, go)
	  (Go for the moon)
	  (Go, go, go for the moon)

	  Hey now, you're an all star. Get the game on, go
	  play. Hey now, you're a rockstar. Get the show on,
	  get paid. And all that glitters is gold. Only
	  shootin' stars-

	  Somebody once asked, "Could I spare some change for
	  gas? I need to get myself away from this place." I
	  said, "Yep, what a concept. I could use a little fuel
	  myself." And we could all use a little change.

	  Well, the years start comin' and the don't stop
	  comin'. Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
